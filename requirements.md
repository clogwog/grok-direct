# Requirements

This project is a chrome plugin that will also run on brave browser.

The plugin will be used allow users :
- open an entry box to allow users to enter a search query
- open an new named tab in the browser that will go to grok.com
- paste in the search query into the entry box and
- 'press' the enter key
- - if the named tab is already opened in the browser, it will bring it to the front instead of opening a new one and paste in the query and 'press' the enter key
- keep a README.md with the documentation on how to use the plugin up to date at all times
